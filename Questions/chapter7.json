    "explanation": "The code compiles, making option F incorrect. An instance variable with the same name as an inherited instance variable is hidden, not overridden. This means that both variables exist, and the one that is used depends on the location and reference type. Because the main() method uses a reference type of Speedster to access the numSpots variable, the variable in the Speedster class, not the Cheetah class, must be set to 50. Option A is incorrect, as it reassigns the method parameter to itself. Option B is incorrect, as it assigns the method parameter the value of the instance variable in Cheetah, which is 0. Option C is incorrect, as it assigns the value to the instance variable in Cheetah, not Speedster. Option D is incorrect, as it assigns the method parameter the value of the instance variable in Speedster, which is 0. Options A, B, C, and D all print 0 at runtime. Option E is the correct answer, as it assigns the instance variable numSpots in the Speedster class a value of 50.

    "explanation": "The Moose class doesn’t compile, as the final variable antlers is not initialized when it is declared, in an instance initializer, or in a constructor. Caribou and Reindeer are not immutable because they are not marked final, which means a subclass could extend them and add mutable fields. Elk and Deer are both immutable classes since they are marked final and only include private final members, making options D and E correct.

The printName() method that takes an int value on line 5 is correctly overridden in the Spider class on line 9. Remember, an overridden method can have a broader access modifier, and protected access is broader than package access. Because of polymorphism, the overridden method replaces the method on all calls, even if an Arthropod reference variable is used, as is done in the main() method. For these reasons, the overridden method is called on lines 14 and 15, printing Spider twice. Note that the short value is automatically cast to the larger type of int, which then uses the overridden method. Line 16 calls the overloaded method in the Arthropod class, as the long value 5L does not match the overridden method, resulting in Arthropod being printed. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."

    ],
    "explanation": "The code compiles without issue. The question is making sure you know that superclass constructors are called in the same manner in abstract classes as they are in non-abstract classes. Line 9 calls the constructor on line 6. The compiler automatically inserts super() as the first line of the constructor defined on line 6. The program then calls the constructor on line 3 and prints Wow-. Control then returns to line 6, and Oh- is printed. Finally, the method call on line 10 uses the version of fly() in the Pelican class, since it is marked private and the reference type of var is resolved as Pelican. The final output is Wow-Oh-Pelican, making option D the correct answer. Remember that private methods cannot be overridden. If the reference type of chirp was Bird, then the code would not compile as it would not be accessible outside the class."

Option B does not compile, as inserting this() at line 3 results in a compiler error, since there is no matching constructor. Option C is correct, as short can be implicitly cast to int, resulting in this((short)1) calling the constructor declared on line 5. In addition, this(null) calls the String constructor declared on line 10. Option D does not compile because inserting super() on line 14 results in an invalid constructor call. The Howler class does not contain a no-argument constructor. Option E is also incorrect. Inserting this(2L) at line 3 results in a recursive constructor definition. The compiler detects this and reports an error. Option F is incorrect, as using super(null) on line 14 does not match any parent constructors. If an explicit cast was used, such as super((Integer)null), then the code would have compiled but would throw an exception at runtime during unboxing. Finally, option G is incorrect because the superclass Howler does not contain a no-argument constructor.

The variable declaration and instance initializers are run first, setting value to tac. The constructor declared on line 5 is called, resulting in value being set to tacb. Remember, a static main() method can access private constructors declared in the same class. Line 17 creates another PolarBear instance, replacing the bear reference declared on line 16. First, value is initialized to tac as before. Line 17 calls the constructor declared on line 8, since String is the narrowest match of a String literal. This constructor then calls the overloaded constructor declared on line 5, resulting in value being updated to tacb. Control returns to the previous constructor, with line 10 updating value to tacbf, and making option C the correct answer. Note that if the constructor declared on line 8 did not exist, then the constructor on line 12 would match.

Next, an instance of Arachnid is initialized on line 15. There are two instance initializers in Arachnid, and they run in order, appending cr to the StringBuilder, resulting in a value of uqcr.

    "explanation": "The eat() method is private in the Mammal class. Since it is not inherited in the Primate class, it is neither overridden nor overloaded, making options A and B incorrect. The drink() method in Mammal is correctly hidden in the Monkey class, as the signature is the same and both are static, making option D correct and option C incorrect. The version in the Monkey class throws a new exception, but it is unchecked; therefore, it is allowed. The dance() method in Mammal is correctly overloaded in the Monkey class because the signatures are not the same, making option E incorrect and option F correct. For methods to be overridden, the signatures must match exactly. Finally, line 12 is an invalid override and does not compile, as int is not covariant with void, making options G and H both incorrect."

    "explanation": "The program compiles and runs without issue, making options A through D incorrect. The fly() method is correctly overridden in each subclass since the signature is the same, the access modifier is less restrictive, and the return types are covariant. For covariance, Macaw is a subtype of Parrot, which is a subtype of Bird, so overridden return types are valid. Likewise, the constructors are all implemented properly, with explicit calls to the parent constructors as needed. Line 19 calls the overridden version of fly() defined in the Macaw class, as overriding replaces the method regardless of the reference type. This results in feathers being assigned a value of 3. The Macaw object is then cast to Parrot, which is allowed because Macaw inherits Parrot. The feathers variable is visible since it isdefined in the Bird class, and line 19 prints 3, making option E the correct answer."

    ],
    "explanation": "The code compiles and runs without issue, making option E incorrect. The Child class overrides the setName() method and hides the static name variable defined in the inherited Person class. Since variables are only hidden, not overridden, there are two distinct name variables accessible, depending on the location and reference type. Line 8 creates a Child instance, which is implicitly cast to a Person reference type on line 9. Line 10 uses the Child reference type, updating Child.name to Elysia. Line 11 uses the Person reference type, updating Person.name to Sophia. Lines 12 and 13 both call the overridden setName() instance method declared on line 6. This sets Child.name to Webby on line 12 and then to Olivia on line 13. The final values of Child.name and Person.name are Olivia and Sophia, respectively, making option D the correct answer."

    "answer": [
      "B"

    "explanation": "The program compiles, making option F incorrect. The constructors are called from the child class upward, but since each line of a constructor is a call to another constructor, via this() or super(), they are ultimately executed in a top-down manner. On line 29, the main() method calls the Fennec() constructor declared on line 19. Remember, integer literals in Java are considered int by default. This constructor calls the Fox() constructor defined on line 12, which in turn calls the overloaded Fox() constructor declared on line 11. Since the constructor on line 11 does not explicitly call a parent constructor, the compiler inserts a call to the no-argument super() constructor, which exists on line 3 of the Canine class. Line 3 is then executed, adding q to the output, and the compiler chain is unwound. Line 11 then executes, adding p, followed by line 14, adding z. Finally, line 21 is executed, and j is added, resulting in a final value for logger of qpzj and making option B correct."

This involves invoking the static variable declarations and static initializers. The program first prints 1, followed by 8. Then we follow the constructor pathway from the object created on line 14 upward, initializing each class instance using a top-down approach. Within each class, the instance initializers are run, followed by the referenced constructors. The Antelope instance is initialized, printing 24, followed by the Gazelle instance, printing 93.
