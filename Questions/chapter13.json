    "explanation": "18. C, E, G. A valid Callable lambda expression takes no parameters (unless specified) and returns a value. Option C returns an int, option E returns a String, and option G returns an int after performing an action. Option A is invalid because it has an unneeded parameter. Option B does not return a value, and option F takes an input parameter, which is not consistent with a typical no-argument Callable. Option D is syntactically correct but would be equivalent to returning null; however, the explanation in the answer file specifies options C, E, and G as the valid ones."

Since getInstance() is a static method and sellTickets() is an instance method, lines k1 and k4 synchronize on different objects, making option D incorrect. The class is not thread-safe because the addTickets() method is not synchronized, and option E is incorrect. Finally, option F is correct because the getInstance() method is synchronized. Since the constructor is private, this method is the only way to create an instance of TicketManager outside the class.
