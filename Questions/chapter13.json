    "explanation": "18. C, E, G. A valid Callable lambda expression takes no parameters (unless specified) and returns a value. Option C returns an int, option E returns a String, and option G returns an int after performing an action. Option A is invalid because it has an unneeded parameter. Option B does not return a value, and option F takes an input parameter, which is not consistent with a typical no-argument Callable. Option D is syntactically correct but would be equivalent to returning null; however, the explanation in the answer file specifies options C, E, and G as the valid ones."

If a thread executor with more threads was used, then the s2++ operations could overwrite each other, making the second value indeterminate at the end of the program.

Since getInstance() is a static method and sellTickets() is an instance method, lines k1 and k4 synchronize on different objects, making option D incorrect. The class is not thread-safe because the addTickets() method is not synchronized, and option E is incorrect. Finally, option F is correct because the getInstance() method is synchronized. Since the constructor is private, this method is the only way to create an instance of TicketManager outside the class. The first thread to enter the method will set the instance variable, and all other threads will use the existing value. This is a singleton pattern."
