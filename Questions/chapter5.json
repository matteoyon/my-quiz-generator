      "B. A variable is effectively final only if it is marked final.",

    "answer": [
      "A",
      "E"
    ],
    "explanation": "Instance and static variables can be marked final, making option A correct. Effectively final means a local variable is not marked final but whose value does not change after it is set, making option B incorrect. Option C is incorrect, as final refers only to the reference to an object, not its contents. Option D is incorrect, as var and final can be used together. Finally, option E is correct: once a primitive is marked final, it cannot be modified."

    "explanation": "The keyword void is a return type. Only the access modifier or optional specifiers are allowed before the return type. Option C is correct, creating a method with private access. Option B is also correct, creating a method with package access and the optional specifier final. Since package access does not use a modifier, we get to jump right to final. Option A is incorrect because package access omits the access modifier rather than specifying default. Option D is incorrect because Java is case sensitive. It would have been correct if public were the choice. Option E is incorrect because the method already has a void return type. Option F is incorrect because labels are not allowed for methods."

Option B does not compile because null requires a reference object as the return type. Since int is primitive, it is not a reference object. Option D is correct because it returns an int value. Option E does not compile because it tries to return a double when the return type is int. Since a double cannot be assigned to an int, it cannot be returned as one either. Option F does not compile because no value is actually returned."

    "answer": [
      "D"

    "explanation": "Option D is correct. A common practice is to set all fields to be private and all methods to be public. Option A is incorrect because protected access allows everything that package access allows and additionally allows subclasses access. Option B is incorrect because the class is public. This means that other classes can see the class. However, they cannot call any of the methods or read any of the fields. It is essentially a useless class. Option C is incorrect because package access applies to the whole package. Option E is incorrect because Java has no such wildcard access capability."

    "explanation": "Rope runs line 3, setting LENGTH to 5, and then immediately after that runs the static initializer, which sets it to 10. Line 5 in the Chimp class calls the static method normally and prints swing and a space. Line 6 also calls the static method. Java allows calling a static method through an instance variable, although it is not recommended. Line 7 uses the static import on line 2 to reference LENGTH. For these reasons, option B is correct."

    "explanation": "Line 10 does not compile because static methods are not allowed to call instance methods. Even though we are calling play() as if it were an instance method and an instance exists, Java knows play() is really a static method and treats it as such. Since this is the only line that does not compile, option B is correct. If line 10 is removed, the code prints swing-swing, making option E correct. It does not throw a NullPointerException on line 17 because play() is a static method. Java looks at the type of the reference for rope2 and translates the call to Rope.play()."

    "answer": [
      "B"
    ],
    "explanation": "The test for effectively final is if the final modifier can be added to the local variable and the code still compiles. The monkey variable declared on line 11 is not effectively final because it is modified on line 13. The giraffe and name variables declared on lines 13 and 14, respectively, are effectively final and not modified after they are set. The name variable declared on line 17 is not effectively final since it is modified on line 22. Finally, the food variable on line 18 is not effectively final since it is modified on line 20.

Line 4 doesn’t compile because bench is not set in either of these locations. Line 15 doesn’t compile because final variables are not allowed to be set after that point. Line 11 doesn’t compile because name is set twice: once in the declaration and again in the static block. Line 12 doesn’t compile because rightRope is set twice as well.

    "answer": [
      "B",
      "D"
    ],
    "explanation": "Option A is incorrect because it has the same parameter list of types and therefore the same signature as the original method. Options B and D are the correct answers, as they are valid method overloads in which the types of parameters change. When overloading methods, the return type and access modifiers do not need to be the same. Options C and E are incorrect because the method name is different. Options F and G do not compile. There can be at most one varargs parameter, and it must be the last element in the parameter list."
