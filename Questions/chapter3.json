Option D is also correct and is a common way to print the elements of an array in reverse order. Option E does not compile and is therefore incorrect. You can declare multiple elements in a for loop, but the data type must be listed only once, such as in for (int i=0, j=3; …). Finally, option F is incorrect because the first element of the array is skipped. Since the conditional expression is checked before the loop is executed the first time, the first value of i used inside the body of the loop will be 1."

Note that options E and F are equivalent to options B and D, respectively, since unlabeled statements apply to the most inner loop. Studying the loops, the first time the condition is true is in the second iteration of the inner loop, when row is 1 and col is 1. Option A is incorrect because this causes the loop to exit immediately with count only being set to 1. Options B, C, and E follow the same pathway. First, count is incremented to 1 on the first inner loop, and then the inner loop is exited. On the next iteration of the outer loop, row is 2 and col is 0, so execution exits the inner loop immediately. On the third iteration of the outer loop, row is 3 and col is 0, so count is incremented to 2. In the next iteration of the inner loop, the sum is even, so we exit, and our program is complete, making options B, C, and E each correct. Options D and F are both incorrect, as they cause the inner and outer loops to execute multiple times, with count having a value of 5 when done. You don’t need to trace through all the iterations; just stop when the value of count exceeds 2."

Line 16 is not a compile-time constant since any int value can be passed as a parameter. Marking it final does not change this, so it doesn’t compile. Line 18 does not compile because Sunday is not marked as final. Being effectively final is insufficient. Finally, line 19 does not compile because DayOfWeek.MONDAY is not an int value.

    ],
    "answer": [
      "A",
      "E"
    ],
    "explanation": "The most important thing to notice when reading this code is that the innermost loop is an infinite loop. Therefore, you are looking for solutions that skip the innermost loop entirely or that exit that loop. Option A is correct, as break L2 on line 8 causes the second inner loop to exit every time it is entered, skipping the innermost loop entirely. For option B, the first continue on line 8 causes the execution to skip the innermost loop on the first iteration of the second loop but not the second iteration of the second loop. The innermost loop is executed, and with continue on line 12, it produces an infinite loop at runtime, making option B incorrect. Option C is incorrect because it contains a compiler error. The label L3 is not visible outside its loop. Option D is incorrect, as it is equivalent to option B since the unlabeled break and continue apply to the nearest loop and therefore produce an infinite loop at runtime. Like option A, the continue L2 on line 8 allows the innermost loop to be executed the second time the second loop is called. The continue L2 on line 12 exits the infinite loop, though, causing control to return to the second loop. Since the first and second loops terminate, the code terminates, and option E is a correct answer."

    "explanation": "The code compiles without issue, making options F and G incorrect. Remember, var is supported in both switch and while loops, provided the compiler determines that the type is compatible with these statements. In addition, the variable one is allowed in a case clause because it is a final local variable, making it a compile-time constant. The value of tailFeathers is 3, which matches the second case clause, making 5 the first output. The while loop is executed twice, with the pre-decrement operator (--) modifying the value of tailFeathers from 3 to 2 and then to 1 on the second loop. For this reason, the final output is 5 2 1, making option E the correct answer."

If it had been used as the case value on line 15, it would have caused a compilation error since it is not marked final. Since \"violin\" and \"VIOLIN\" are not an exact match, the default branch of the switch statement is executed at runtime.

    "explanation": "The code snippet does not contain any compilation errors, so options D and E are incorrect. There is a problem with this code snippet, though. While it may seem complicated, the key is to notice that the variable r is updated outside of the do/while loop. This is allowed from a compilation standpoint, since it is defined before the loop, but it means the innermost loop never breaks the termination condition r <= 1. At runtime, this will produce an infinite loop the first time the innermost loop is entered, making option F the correct answer."

For these reasons, at least two lines must be corrected. Next, lines 43, 44, and 45 do not compile because the numeric values are not compatible with the reference type for Object. We can fix this by changing line 41 to pass speed as a compatible type, such as Integer. Finally, the default clause on line 46 dominates the proceeding case null on line 47.
