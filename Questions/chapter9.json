      "A",
      "F"
    ],
    "explanation": "1. A, F. Option E is incorrect for both scenarios, as SequencedTreeSet does not exist. For the first scenario, the answer needs to implement List because the scenario allows duplicates, narrowing it down to options A and D. Option A is a better answer than option D because LinkedList is both a List and a Queue, and you just need a regular List. For the second scenario, the answer needs to implement Map because you are dealing with key/value pairs per the unique id field. This narrows it down to options B and F. Since the question talks about ordering, you need the TreeMap. Therefore, the answer is option F."

Line 7 creates the Hello instance with the generic type String. It also passes an int to the println() method, which gets autoboxed into an Integer. While the println() method takes a generic parameter of type T, it is not the same <T> defined for the class on line 1. Instead, it is a different T defined as part of the method declaration on line 3. Therefore, the String argument on line 7 applies only to the class. The method can take any object as a parameter, including autoboxed primitives. Line 8 creates the Hello instance with the generic type Object since no type is specified for that instance. It passes a boolean to println(), which gets autoboxed into a Boolean. The result is that hi-1hola-true is printed, making option B correct."

      "A",
      "E"
    ],
    "explanation": "18. A, E. The key to this question is keeping track of the types. Line 48 is a Map<Integer, Integer>. Line 49 builds a List out of a Set of Entry objects, giving us List<Entry<Integer, Integer>>. This causes a compiler error on line 56 since we can’t multiply an Entry object by two. Lines 51–54 are all of type List<Integer>. The first three are immutable, and the one on line 54 is mutable. This means line 57 throws an UnsupportedOperationException since we attempt to modify the list. Line 58 would work if we could get to it. Since there is one compiler error and one runtime error, options A and E are correct."

The second call to merge() sees that the map currently has a null value for that key. It does not call the mapping function but instead replaces it with the new value of 3.
