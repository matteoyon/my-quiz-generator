    ],
    "answer": [
      "C"
    ],
    "explanation": "1. C. Since the question asks about putting data into a structured object, the best class would be one that deserializes the data. Therefore, ObjectInputStream is the best choice, which is option C. ObjectWriter, BufferedStream, and ObjectReader are not I/O stream classes. ObjectOutputStream is an I/O class but is used to serialize data, not deserialize it. FileReader can be used to read text file data and construct an object, but the question asks what would be the best class to use for binary data."

Option B is incorrect because the path could be a file or directory within the file system. There is no rule that files have to end with a file extension. Option D is incorrect, as it is possible to create a File reference to files and directories that do not exist. Option E is also incorrect. The delete() method returns false if the file or directory cannot be deleted. Character stream classes often include built-in convenience methods for working with String data, so option F is correct.

Therefore, none of the members of Bird will be serialized. Even if you didn’t know that, you should know what happens on deserialization. During deserialization, Java calls the constructor of the first nonserializable parent. In this case, the Bird constructor is called, with name being set to Matt, making option C correct.

We can eliminate BufferedWriter, ObjectOutputStream, and BufferedReader since their names do not end in InputStream.

    "explanation": "19. C. The code compiles and runs without issue, so option G is incorrect. If you simplify the redundant path symbols, p1 and p2 represent the same path, /lizard/walking.txt. Therefore, isSameFile() returns true. The second output is false, because equals() checks only if the path values are the same, without reducing the path symbols. Finally, mismatch() sees that the contents are the same and returns -1. For these reasons, option C is correct."

It must also contain instance members that either are marked transient or are serializable. The instance member stripes is of type Object, which is not serializable. If Object implemented Serializable, all objects would be serializable by default, defeating the purpose of having the Serializable interface. Therefore, the Zebra class is not serializable, with the program throwing an exception at runtime if serialized and making option G correct.

Walking the root directory with the filter expression will print all .java files in the root directory (along with all .java files in the directory tree), making option A correct. Option B is incorrect because it will skip files and directories that do not end in the .java extension. Option C is also incorrect as Files.walk() does not follow symbolic links by default.

Even though /flip exists, createDirectories() does not throw an exception if the path already exists. If createDirectory() were used instead, option F would be correct. Next, the copy() command takes a target that is the path to the new file location, not the directory to be copied into. Therefore, the target path should be /flip/sounds.txt, not /flip.
