The requires transitive directive is used when specifying a module to be used by the requesting module and any other modules that use the requesting module. Therefore, dog needs to specify the transitive relationship, and option G is correct. The module puppy just needs requires dog, and it gets the transitive dependencies, making option D correct. However, requires transitive does everything requires does and more, which makes option H the final correct answer."
